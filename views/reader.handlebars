				"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?" the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep.

				Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted.

				I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his tone had implied something moreâ€”that they weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it without success.
