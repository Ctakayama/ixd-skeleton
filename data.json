        "content":"Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was a popular English writer, social critic, and one of the great Victorian novelists. In one of his best known works, A Christmas Carol, a greedy old miser named Ebenezer Scrooge is visited in the night by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns that he must change his selfish ways before it is too late. Marley tells him that he will be visited by three spirits. In the second chapter, Scrooge meets the first spirit, Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time from Scrooge’s sad and lonely childhood to when he was a young man and his fiancée left him because of his obsession with money. Upset at the pain these memories unearth, Scrooge sends the spirit away. In the following third chapter, Scrooge meets the second of three spirits: the Ghost of Christmas Present."
